# Compositional Structured Explanation Generation with Dynamic Modularized Reasoning

Code and Data for the \*SEM paper 


We propose a new task, compositional structured explanation generation (CSEG), to facilitate research on compositional generalization in reasoning. CSEG tests a model's ability to generalize from generating entailment trees with a limited number of inference steps to more steps. 

We propose a new dynamic modularized reasoning model, MORSE, that factorizes the inference process into modules, where each module represents a functional unit. 


## Code
1. Prepare the dataset
2. Do pre-training with primitve data *args.do_finetuning = "p1"*
3. Do fine-tuning with composition data *args.do_finetuning = "p2"*
3. Run the script
```
sh run-test-module.sh
```

## Data Download (OneDrive)
We reset the data for compositional generalization tests. Details can be found in our paper.

**Files**: data for DBPedia and EnatailmentBank

## Evaluation
For evaluation, we follow ['Explaining Answers with Entailment Trees'](https://github.com/allenai/entailment_bank):
1. Download the bleurt-large-512 model fromÂ https://github.com/google-research/bleurt/blob/master/checkpoints.md under 'scorer folder/'
2. Set the evaluation parameter 'evaluation_root_dir'
3. Run the script
